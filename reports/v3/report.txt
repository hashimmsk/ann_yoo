What This Tool Does
------------------------
datanuri reads information from past brain cancer trials and gives two friendly answers: how many
months someone like the patient usually stays stable, and the chance they are still doing well after
six months. The goal is to give doctors and families a quick, grounded snapshot that supports their
own judgement.

To teach the program, we fed it the cleaned research spreadsheet, asked it not to look at columns
that only describe the studies, and saved age, sex, surgery success, daily activity scores, lab
signals, and treatment history. It practices on most of the rows and we check its answers on the
remaining rows it has never seen.

How We Checked It
------------------------
The program repeats its study until the answers stop improving. Along the way we slow the learning
if it races ahead, and we keep the best checkpoint. If the main program ever fails to load, older
backups and even simple look-up rules step in so that the service still responds.

How Well It Performed
------------------------
After practice the program faced a saved slice of trial records. The table shows how far each
approach usually missed the real answer by (in months) and how often it correctly spotted a patient
still doing well at the six-month mark.

+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Program             |   Average miss (months) | Confidence score (0–1)   | Six-month calls correct (%)   |
+=====================+=========================+==========================+===============================+
| datanuri (v7a)      |                    0.72 | 0.93                     | 90                            |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Straight-line guess |                    0.77 |                          |                               |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Gentle slope guess  |                    1.08 |                          |                               |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Decision forest     |                    1.06 |                          |                               |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+

In short, datanuri offered the smallest average miss and is the only option above that still shares
a confidence number for the six-month question.

How the Code Builds the Answers
------------------------
1. Gather and tidy the data

We start by opening the cleaned trial spreadsheet. Columns that only describe the study are removed.
We keep the details that describe the person: age, sex, surgery success, daily activity score, lab
signal, and treatment history. We also make sure the two goal columns we care about are present.

2. Set aside a fair test

Most rows are used for practice, while a smaller slice is hidden away for checking later. When the
yes/no six-month result is available, we shuffle the rows in a way that keeps the same balance of
successes in both piles so the check feels fair.

3. Put numbers on the same scale

Some features are big numbers, some are small. We teach the program to centre and scale the inputs
using only the practice rows, and we reuse the same scaler later so the service speaks the same
language as the training run.

4. Teach the brain

The model itself is a stack of layers that share information, then split into two heads. One head
guesses months, the other gives the six-month chance. Dropout and other guard rails keep the network
from memorising instead of learning.

5. Keep the best version

During training we nudge the learning rate, stop early if progress stalls, and only save the best
checkpoint. A temperature control keeps the six-month confidence number calm and realistic.

6. Check the work

After training we run the model on the saved-away slice. We measure how many months off the guess
was on average and how often it called the six-month outcome right. The tables in this report are
generated from those numbers.

7. Share the answers safely

When the service runs, it loads the saved model and scaler, applies a small clinical adjustment to
the six-month chance, and serves the `/predict` and `/debug-predict` endpoints. If something goes
wrong, older checkpoints or simple fallbacks step in so the user still gets guidance.

Sample Stories
------------------------
Below are three example patients. For each one we list the real time they remained steady, what
datanuri guessed, and how that compares with a more traditional approach.

+-----------+----------------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| Patient   |   Real months stable |   datanuri guess |   Traditional guess |   Chance of six-month wellness (%) |
+===========+======================+==================+=====================+====================================+
| Example 1 |                 1.90 |             1.94 |                2.07 |                                 38 |
+-----------+----------------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| Example 2 |                 4.20 |             4.28 |                4.64 |                                 68 |
+-----------+----------------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| Example 3 |                 7.30 |             7.02 |                9.01 |                                 80 |
+-----------+----------------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+

The final column shows the chance, expressed as a percentage, that each person is still doing well
at six months. If the main program cannot supply the number, we fall back to a cautious estimate so
no one is left without guidance.

Takeaway
------------------------
datanuri brings the careful math into a plain-language summary. It gives a quick, calm starting
point for conversations, while doctors continue to make the final call.
