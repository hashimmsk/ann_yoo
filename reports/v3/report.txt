What This Tool Does
------------------------
datanuri reads information from past brain cancer trials and gives two friendly answers: how many
months someone like the patient usually stays stable, and the chance they are still doing well after
six months. The goal is to give doctors and families a quick, grounded snapshot that supports their
own judgement.

To teach the program, we fed it the cleaned research spreadsheet, asked it not to look at columns
that only describe the studies, and saved age, sex, surgery success, daily activity scores, lab
signals, and treatment history. It practices on most of the rows and we check its answers on the
remaining rows it has never seen.

How We Checked It
------------------------
The program repeats its study until the answers stop improving. Along the way we slow the learning
if it races ahead, and we keep the best checkpoint. If the main program ever fails to load, older
backups and even simple look-up rules step in so that the service still responds.

How Well It Performed
------------------------
After practice the program faced a saved slice of trial records. The table shows how far each
approach usually missed the real answer by (in months) and how often it correctly spotted a patient
still doing well at the six-month mark.

+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Program             |   Average miss (months) | Confidence score (0–1)   | Six-month calls correct (%)   |
+=====================+=========================+==========================+===============================+
| datanuri (v7a)      |                    0.72 | 0.93                     | 90                            |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Straight-line guess |                    0.77 |                          |                               |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Gentle slope guess  |                    1.08 |                          |                               |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Decision forest     |                    1.06 |                          |                               |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------+

In short, datanuri offered the smallest average miss and is the only option above that still shares
a confidence number for the six-month question.

Sample Stories
------------------------
Below are three example patients. For each one we list the real time they remained steady, what
datanuri guessed, and how that compares with a more traditional approach.

+-----------+----------------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| Patient   |   Real months stable |   datanuri guess |   Traditional guess |   Chance of six-month wellness (%) |
+===========+======================+==================+=====================+====================================+
| Example 1 |                 1.90 |             1.94 |                2.07 |                                 38 |
+-----------+----------------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| Example 2 |                 4.20 |             4.28 |                4.64 |                                 68 |
+-----------+----------------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| Example 3 |                 7.30 |             7.02 |                9.01 |                                 80 |
+-----------+----------------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+

The final column shows the chance, expressed as a percentage, that each person is still doing well
at six months. If the main program cannot supply the number, we fall back to a cautious estimate so
no one is left without guidance.

Takeaway
------------------------
datanuri brings the careful math into a plain-language summary. It gives a quick, calm starting
point for conversations, while doctors continue to make the final call.
